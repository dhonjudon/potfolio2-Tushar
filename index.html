      <p class="describe">
        I’m someone who’s curious and always trying to understand how things
        work. When something catches my interest, I don’t stop at the basic
        explanation. I like to dig deeper, ask questions, and figure things out
        in a practical, simple way. Learning step by step and improving
        gradually is something I enjoy. I’m straightforward and honest, and I
        prefer keeping things real. If something is confusing, I say it. If I
        want to learn something new, I go for it without hesitation. I like
        conversations that are direct but still fun, and I enjoy adding a bit of
        humor to keep things light. I’m also interested in front-end development
        because it mixes creativity with logic. Turning ideas into clean, modern
        visuals using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript feels rewarding. Fixing designs
        or solving layout issues teaches me patience and attention to detail.
